% LIF_XCORR cross-correlogram/covariogram histogram
%
%   LIF_XCORR(A,B,BINSIZE,T) where A and B are time-stamp (in seconds) arrays of spiking events,
%   BINSIZE is the size of the sample bin in seconds, T is a 2-element array specifying the start and 
%   end of the spike trains in seconds. Computes the cross-correlogram between two spike trains, 
%   with A as the reference train. This is most useful when the spike trains can be compared over their entirety. 
%   For computing correlations between sets of spike trains recorded over many trials, use either
%   JPSTH or COVARIOGRAM (the latter calls this function)
%
%   LIF_XCORR(...,MAXLAG) sets the size of the maximum 
%   interval returned to be +/- MAXLAG seconds; 
%
%   [Y,BINS,F1,F2] = LIF_XCORR(...) returns the binned interval counts Y and the bin centres B. 
%   Plot using BAR(BINS,Y,1). Can also optionally specify F1 and F2 to return the mean firing rates of trains A and B.
%   
%   NOTE#1: specify a maximum interval MAXLAG for best results. It ensures that the histogram is
%   approximately flat if the signals are not correlated. If the whole
%   signal is used for both reference and comparison, then edge effects
%   will result as the extreme intervals are necessarily low in frequency.
%
%   NOTE#2: try initial values of BINSIZE = 0.001 and MAXLAG = 0.1 and
%   adjust as necessary - BINSIZE should generally be the quantising step of the underlying spike-trains,
%   or a sufficiently small time-window to guarantee a single spike per bin in each train; so for simulated trains,
%   this could be the smallest absolute refractory period if known
%
%   NOTE#3: to get autocorrelogram, just enter the same spike-train for A and B
